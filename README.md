### Introduction
I created this dApp to simply retrieve transaction lists from users. I
spent a lot of time researching how to build Ethereum apps moreso than
on the Front end side of things. Really exciting stuff and found I was
learning a lot. I'm at the point where I would really start to add in 
animations and refine styling for different use cases.

I did not get to many of the extra additions on the assignment but I
imagine it would only be a few more hours to do so. Redux and React
Router would be a simple addition.


### Requirements
I used truffle to unbox the app, sign and migrate contracts. It was
installed globally. I don't think it's needed just to run the SPA. I
used UIKit and SASS for styling. React for components. NPM package
etherscan-api. Thats about it.

### How to run
To develop locally

```
cd client
npm run start
```

### TODO

I felt it would be a good idea to let you know how
I'd approach next steps.

1. Error messages
2. Add React Router so hashes persist between navigation
3. Add Redux for simple state management
4. Add Pagination for transaction list longer than 50 lines
5. Use Flexbox instead of tables
6. Shorten transaction hashes and limit amount of characters
7. Mobile styling
8. Icons
9. Test Cases
